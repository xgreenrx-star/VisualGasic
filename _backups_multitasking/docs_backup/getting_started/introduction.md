# Introduction to Visual Gasic

## About Visual Gasic

Godot Engine is a feature-packed, cross-platform game engine to create 2D and 3D games from a unified interface. **Visual Gasic** is a language extension that sits on top of Godot, replacing GDScript with a **BASIC** dialect deeply integrated into the engine.

### Why BASIC?

While GDScript is excellent, many developers have fond memories of—or high productivity with—classic BASIC languages like Visual Basic 6.0, QBasic, or BlitzBasic. Visual Gasic aims to bring that "rapid application development" feel to a modern engine.

## The Godot Editor

Visual Gasic uses the standard Godot Editor. You still use the **Scene** dock, the **FileSystem** dock, and the **Inspector**. The only difference is in the **Script** tab, where you will write `.bas` files instead of `.gd` files.

## Project Structure

A project contains:
-   `project.godot`: Global configuration.
-   `.tscn` files: Scenes (Levels, Characters, UI forms).
-   `.bas` files: Your logic code.
-   Assets: Images (`.png`, `.svg`) and Audio (`.wav`, `.ogg`).

## Summary

*   Visual Gasic is a **language extension** for Godot.
*   You use the standard **Godot Editor**.
*   Scripts use the `.bas` extension and BASIC syntax.
