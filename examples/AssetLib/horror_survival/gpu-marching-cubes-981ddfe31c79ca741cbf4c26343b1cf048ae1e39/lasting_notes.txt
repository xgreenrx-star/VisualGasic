world_player needs to be (updated) inspected and deleted after audit of successful transition to v2.
world_player_legacy might be useful as groundwork but will need to be reintegrated into v2

res://modules/debug_module/ needs to be moved and reintegrated to res://addons/debug_menu/

The whole res://modules/tools/ folder is all about researching and making a zombie ragdoll.
It might have failed a bit. A good resource is the end this video. Althought we couldn't make ragdoll work still.
Needs investigation into zombie model by someone else.

The shovel item is also needing research on how to place and isolate materials correctly, it is nowhere complete.
Along with the axe, pickaxe and others.

Needs porting of prefab placing mode from legacy.
We had ability to select two points and save prefab, althought not the surrounding terrain.
