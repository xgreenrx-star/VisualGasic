Software Porting is the answer to old large code that is mystical. You start a new module and let it ask questions about entire thing until we reimplement/port entire thing into new module with manageable pieces.


Software porting is adapting an application to work in a new environment, like a different operating system (Windows to Linux), CPU, or hardware, by modifying its code or dependencies to maintain functionality, essentially making it run "somewhere else" without a full rewrite. 

It is important to ask to audit software porting process from time to time.

You have to make complete porting audit against original.

Always make a porting reference document with maximum accuracy and code line numbers. 

Always cycle around the porting subjects in ultrathink, to not miss possible connected features.
