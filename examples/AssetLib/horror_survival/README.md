Horror Survival Game Project (upstream included)

Upstream: https://github.com/BoQsc/Horror-Survival-Game-Project
License: CC0 (project and code under CC0 per upstream notes)

The upstream project contains advanced features (marching cubes, greedy meshing). We will create a small VisualGasic demo focusing on a visual slice (e.g., marching cubes shader or a small voxel sample) in the `demo/` directory.

TODO:
- Extract a minimal demo and add attribution and instructions.
