@abstract class_name BallisticSolutions extends Object


## Library for calculating interception times, impact positions, and firing vectors, taking into account the velocities and accelerations of both projectile and target.
##
## [BsPosition] - Provides methods for computing projectile positions, impact positions, and displacement calculations under constant acceleration. [br]
## [BsTime] - Provides methods for computing interception times between a projectile and a moving target under constant acceleration. [br]
## [BsVelocity] - Provides methods for computing required firing velocities to hit a target under constant acceleration conditions. [br]
## [br]
## [BsEquations] - Provides ballistic equations. [br]
## [BsVectorExtensions] - Extensions for [Vector2], [Vector3], [Vector4].
