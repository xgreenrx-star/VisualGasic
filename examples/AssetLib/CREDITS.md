VisualGasic Examples — Asset Library Conversions

This folder contains converted and referenced assets from the Godot Asset Library.
Each entry below lists the original asset, author, license, and link to the original source. Where possible the original asset is included under its upstream license; see the asset's repository for full licensing details.

Please treat these assets according to their original licenses. For questions about a particular asset, open an issue or contact the original author (linked below).

Conversion Notes:
- For each asset we will create a minimal VisualGasic example that highlights the main visual/interactive feature (shaders, effects, physics or UI). Where appropriate we will reuse upstream shaders or small assets and include them in the example subfolder.
- Full upstream projects will remain in the `examples/AssetLib/<slug>/upstream/` directory (copied from the upstream archive). The converted, minimal demos will live in `examples/AssetLib/<slug>/demo/`.
- Each demo will include a README with conversion details and required attribution.

If you want different attribution text or an alternate organization, tell me and I'll update this file.
