FPS Weapon demo — Missing / noteworthy keywords and limitations

Notes:
- The upstream weapon system relies on resource-based weapons and spawn logic. A bridge `FPSBridge` is included to handle projectile spawning and interactions.
- VisualGasic currently lacks convenience constructors for resource instancing; use pre-instanced projectile scenes or a GDScript bridge.
