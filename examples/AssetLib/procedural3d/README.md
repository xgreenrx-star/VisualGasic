Procedural 3D World Generation (source included)

Upstream: https://github.com/SirNeirda/godot_procedural_infinite_world
License: MIT

Contains a full C# project for procedural terrain and world generation. For VisualGasic examples we will extract an isolated demo (e.g., terrain generation parameters and day/night cycle) to `demo/` and provide a simplified VisualGasic interpreter example or demonstration script.

TODO:
- Identify a small subsection suitable for conversion and create `demo/`.
